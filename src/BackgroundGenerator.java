    //intro 1
    //Growing up in [Location1] was [Adjective1]. I [wasInSituation1], which meant that [Something happened to me].
    //These circumstances led me to life as a(n) [Background], but nothing lasts forever.

    //intro 2
    //I wasn't always a(n) [Class], I grew up as a(n) [occupation modifier][Background] in [Location1]. After I
    //[didSomethingBad], they fired me, which led to my current occupation. But being a [Background] wasn't my final destiny.

    //intro 3
    //They should write songs about [Class]s like me. I may have started my life in [Location1] as a [Background], but I always dreamt I
    //would [doSomethingHeroic] and earn the respect of everyone. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans.

    //Call To Adventure 1
    //One night in [Location1], while I was [verbing] with my [relatives], we were [agressiveVerbed] by a [hostileParty]. After the tradgedy,
    //I swore to never let another person be [aggressive verbed] again, and so I took up arms as an adventurer.

    //Call To Adventure two
    //Being a [Background] doesn't pay enough for my taste, so when I overheard something about high-paying job
    //while [verbing] in [Location 2], I was interested. All I needed was my trusty [Object] and my [random ability] to
    //complete the quest, make sure the [Hostile Party] was [agressiveVerbed], and claim my coin. And that, is how I became an adventurer.

    //Call To Adventure 3
    //One day, after a long night of drinking, some of my [relatives], my friend [getName] and I were exploring an abandoned
    // [mysterySite] near [Location2], but I was separated from them at some point, and found myself standing in front of a [MysteryEntity].
    //I could feel its voice stirring something within me, reminding me of my ideals and strengthening my resolve. If I
    //wanted to achieve my dreams as a [Class], I couldn't just go [verbing] around any longer. I needed to become an adventurer.
